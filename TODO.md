## TODO
- Finish the request body changes so that they all use DTOs rather than Java maps
- Clean up the services in frontend, make sure there is not too much random abstraction since the boilerplate seems high
- Better indicate when a task is completed
- Ability to filter by completed, uncompleted, etc, probably through a task search API which takes arguments and filters accordingly
- Rework frontend colors
- Reusability in task components (a "Common" file which exports common components)
- A "Composite" task
- Finish the forms for TaskAdder
- Implement auth for API
- User accounts
- Automatic https certs through certbot and let's encrypt
- Persistent backend storage
- Timed tasks (after select date, they are marked as expired).
  They should also appear as priority when they are close to the deadline.
- Task priorities
- Home page which displays the most "important" tasks based on some metrics
- Dealing with overflow inside task names
- A "more information" button on a task which holds things like the task's tag
- Tasks that get unlocked based on other tasks
- Task plans (like groups of tasks that can be imported and added to your account, like ready study plans)
